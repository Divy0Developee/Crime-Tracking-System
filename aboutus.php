		CCTNS aims to integrate all the data and records of crime into a Core Application Software (CAS), which is presently spreading across 29 states and 7 union territories of India. CAS was developed by the Bangalore based IT firm, Wipro. It needs to integrate different software and platforms followed by different states and to digitise records of those states which have not digitised their police records. The project also involves training of police personnel and setting up of citizen portal to provide services to citizens.[4]

Crime and Criminals Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) [5]

The Project will interconnect about 15000 Police Stations and additional 5000 offices of supervisory police officers across the country
It will digitize data related to FIR registration, investigation and charge sheets in all police stations.
It would help in developing a national database of crime and criminals
The full implementation of the project with all the new components would lead to a Central citizen portal having linkages with State level citizen portals that will provide a number of citizen friendly services.
The total outlay for the project is 2000 crore rupees, and also includes Operation and Maintenance phase for additional five years up to March 2022.
